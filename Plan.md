# HTML Setup

- 3 div containing images of cups 
    * why
        - we need to show the user which cup is the ball under 
    * how 
        - we can replace the images with the divs in each cup 

- 3 buttons for the cup to sense that it is clicked upon 
    * why
        - so we are able to tell when and what cup is picked 
    * how 
        - we can add event listener

- 3 divs to tell if the player win or loss 
    * why
        - displays the score state to the user so they are able to tell where theu are at in the process of the game

        - we can update the state with text Content on each button click
